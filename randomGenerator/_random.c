/* Random objects */

/* ------------------------------------------------------------------
   The code in this module was based on a download from:
      http://www.math.keio.ac.jp/~matumoto/MT2002/emt19937ar.html

   It was modified in 2002 by Raymond Hettinger as follows:

    * the principal computational lines untouched.

    * renamed genrand_res53() to random_random() and wrapped
      in python calling/return code.

    * genrand_int32() and the helper functions, init_genrand()
      and init_by_array(), were declared static, wrapped in
      Python calling/return code.  also, their global data
      references were replaced with structure references.

    * unused functions from the original were deleted.
      new, original C python code was added to implement the
      Random() interface.

   The following are the verbatim comments from the original code:

   A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/1/26.
   Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.

   Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
   or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
